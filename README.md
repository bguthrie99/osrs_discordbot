# osrs_discordbot

This is a simple Discord bot that performs simulations in the popular online video game known as Old School RuneScape.
Bossing/high-level PvM (player versus monster) is a huge part of the game, where players raid dungeons in order to obtain loot.

This Discord bot allows for simulations of these dungeons to see what items the player would get had they completed them, including icons of the loot they have received. Current supported bosses are Chambers of Xeric, Theatre of Blood, Nightmare, Corporeal Beast, and Gauntlet.

Command format is with the . identifier, so example commands are:

.help
.kill X 1000

Where X is the boss name (cox, tob, nm, corp, gauntlet)

Nothing fancy to show, this was just for fun learning Node.js and practing skills with Git.

If you would like to replicate it, just remember to change the bot's Discord token to yours on the bot.js file.
