# osrs_discordbot

This is a simple Discord bot that performs simulations in the popular online video game known as Old School RuneScape.
Bossing/high-level PvM (player versus monster) is a huge part of the game, where players raid dungeons in order to track down loot.

This Discord bot allows for simulations of these dungeons to see what items the player would get had they completed them.

Nothing fancy to show, this was just for fun learning Node.JS. and to give me practice using Git.

If you would like to replicate it, just remember to change the bot's token to yours on the bot.js file.
